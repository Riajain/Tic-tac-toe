# Tic-tac-toe

Hello fellow programmers!!
I like to code in Java as I find it quite user-friendly(programmer-friendly to be precise).
This project contains a simple yet efficient Java code for the game that we all have played multiple times. Yes, you guessed it right!!. Its Tic-Tac-Toe! I have used the 'swing' framework provided in Java to create this game. It has been made interactive with the proper logic and appropriate pop-ups and alert messages being displayed according to the corresponding user actions.
Hope you enjoy a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
